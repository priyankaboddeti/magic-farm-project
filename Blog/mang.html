          <p>Mango (Mangifera indica) is a sweet and delicious fruit with many
            benefits. It is also known as the “king of fruits” due to its
            impressive nutritional profile. This fruit is native to South Asia
            and has been cultivated for centuries.</p>


          <p>Mangoes belong to the drupe family. They are available in hundreds
            of varieties around the world in different colors and shapes. The
            mango fruit contains about twenty different minerals and vitamins
            and is among the most nutrient-dense fruits available.</p>


            <p> Mangoes are said to possess many antioxidant properties and may
            improve immunity, reduce the risk of heart disease, promote
            digestive health, enhance eyesight, and reduce the risk of certain
            types of cancer.</p>


          <p><b>Health Benefits of Mangoes</b></p>


            <p><b>1. May Improve Immunity</b></p>
            <p>Mangoes are a rich source of essential vitamins that boost
            immunity. The fruit contains vitamin C. This nutrient possesses
            antioxidant properties that may improve immune health. A study
            conducted by Hohenheim University found that mangoes are rich in
            beta-carotene, which is a carotenoid that helps enhance the immune
            system. Vitamin A is another important nutrient in mangoes that
            boosts immunity. This vitamin may fight against infectious
            diseases.</p>


            <p><b>2. May Reduce The Risk Of Heart Disease</b></p>
            <p>Including mangoes in a balanced diet could help reduce body fat
            and control blood sugar levels. This fruit offers potassium and
            magnesium that may reduce the risk of heart disease. The intake of
            magnesium may improve heart health. Potassium acts as a
            vasodilator. It may help reduce stress on the blood vessels and
            promote cardiac function. Mangoes are a rich source of
            beta-carotene. Carotenoids may reduce heart disease risk by
            preventing the oxidation of cholesterol in the arteries.</p>


            <p><b>3. May Improve Digestive Health</b></p>
            <p>Mangoes contain digestive enzymes like amylases. These break down
            complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. This may help improve
            the digestive process, though more research is warranted in this
            aspect.</p>


            <p><b>4. May Support Eye Health</b></p>
            <p>The vitamin A and beta-carotene in mangoes may help boost eye
            health. The severest cases of vitamin A deficiency can even lead
            to blindness. Vitamin A improves eye health and vision.
            Specifically speaking, the vitamin is essential for the optimal
            functioning of the cornea. The human eye has two major carotenoids
            such as lutein and zeaxnthin. Fruits of various colors, in general
            (including mangoes) are a rich source of zeaxanthin and invariably
            help improve eye health. Mangoes also contain lutein that promotes
            vision health.</p>


            <p><b>5. May Reduce Cancer Risk</b></p>
            <p>The pulp of the mango fruit contains carotenoids, ascorbic acid,
            terpenoids, and polyphenols that are said to possess anticancer
            properties. Mangoes are also found to contain unique antioxidants
            that are absent in other fruits and vegetables. Mangiferin has
            also been found to inhibit the growth of colon and liver cancer
            cells.</p>


            <p><b>6. May Help Treat Diabetes</b></p>
            <p>Eating mangoes may help treat diabetes. A study of 20 obese adults
            showed that the consumption of half a fresh mango for 12 weeks
            results in lowered blood glucose levels. Another study conducted
            by the Central Food Technological Research Institute proved that
            the extract of a mango peel has antidiabetic properties. The
            mangiferin in mangoes may have beneficial effects in those with
            type 2 diabetes.</p>


            <p><b>7. May Treat Anemia</b></p>
            <p>Mangoes contain iron. They may help individuals and pregnant women
            with anemia when taken along with other iron-rich foods. The
            vitamin C in mangoes can help with the proper absorption of iron
            in the body.</p>


            <p><b>8. May Promote Brain Health</b></p>
            <p>Mangoes contain vitamin B6. When taken along with other foods rich
            in vitamin B6, it may promote brain health. Some research shows
            that vitamin B6 deficiency could increase the risk of depression
            and seizures.</p>


            <p><b>9. May Help Lower Cholesterol</b></p>
            <p>In a study conducted by the University of Madras, the mangiferin
            in mangoes was found to lower the cholesterol levels in lab
            rats.It was also found to increase the levels of HDL (high-density
            lipoprotein), the good cholesterol.</p>


            <p><b>10. May Aid Weight Loss</b></p>
            <p>A study had emphasized the importance of the mango peel (which
            most of us usually throw away) in inhibiting adipogenesis, or the
            formation of fat cells. This may help with weight loss if coupled
            with the right diet and lifestyle changes. Mangoes contain fiber
            and may potentially help with weight loss.</p>


            <p><b>11. May Promote Liver Health</b></p>
            <p> Consumption of mangoes may enhance liver function. Some anecdotal
            evidence suggests that unripe mangoes may help in treating liver
            disorders. However, research is very limited to prove this claim.</p>


            <p><b>12. May Enhance Skin Health</b></p>
           <p>As already discussed, mangoes are rich in beta-carotene and
            vitamin A. As per a German study, these carotenoids can help
            enrich skin health. Beta-carotene is also a photoprotective agent
            that is thought to quench the photochemical reactions in the
            epidermis, thereby protecting the skin from the ultraviolet rays.
            The polyphenols in mangoes exhibit anticancer activity. They may
            help reduce the risk of skin cancer. Some anecdotal evidence
            suggests that mangoes may also prevent the growth of pimples and
            acne.</p>


            <p><b>13. May Improve Hair Health</b></p>
            <p>Mangoes are a rich source of vitamin A that may improve hair
            health. In mice studies, dietary vitamin A could activate the hair
            follicles to improve the sebum (liquid that moisturizes scalp)
            production and promote scalp health. Mangoes are also rich in
            polyphenols that help fight oxidative stress. Oxidative stress may
            have detrimental effects on hair health.</p>


            <p><b>Different Types of a Mango?</b></p>


            <p>There are close to 400 varieties of mango across the world. Here
            are a few of the most popular ones in India, which is the
            largest producer of the fruit.</p>
