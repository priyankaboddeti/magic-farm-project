                Carrots or gajar as they are popularly called in Hindi, are mostly available
                in orange color but there are other variants available too, such as white,
                yellow, purple, and red. The bright orange color of the carrots is because of
                the presence of beta-carotene, an antioxidant that gets converted into vitamin
                A when we consume it. Carrots are loaded with many vital nutrients such as
                beta-carotene, antioxidants, potassium, fiber, vitamin K, etc. Carrots are
