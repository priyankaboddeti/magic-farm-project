                B3, B5, B6, B7, and vitamin C. It also has folate, iron, potassium, magnesium, chromium, choline, zinc, and
                phosphorus.</p>

            <p><b>Lowers cancer risk</b></p>
            <p>Tomatoes contain antioxidants that target free radicals and oxidative stress contributing to cancerous tumor growth.
                Lycopene is a notable, well-researched antioxidant present in tomatoes that is linked to preventing colon, prostate,
                and even lung cancer.</p>

            <p><b>Decreases stroke risk</b></p>
            <p>Blood clotting should occur when needed, but excessive blood clotting leads to a snowball effect resulting in
                arterial damage and stroke. 75% of people older than 65 years old experience a stroke in their time. Luckily,
                lycopene has anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting properties to prevent and digest plaque build-up.</p>

            <p><b>Reduces blood pressure</b></p>
            <p>High blood pressure suggests long-term impairment in heart health. Especially if you have diabetes, hypertension,
                and/or a history of cardiovascular disease. A study found that tomato consumption helps lower blood pressure to a
                healthy range in type II diabetic people.</p>

            <p><b>Maintains glucose levels</b></p>
            <p>Prolonged blood sugar levels hurt major organs such as the brain and kidneys. If you’re battling diabetes, eating
                more tomatoes is a great way to incorporate more low glycemic foods into your diet to stabilize high blood glucose.

            <p>Daily ingestion of tomatoes is associated with treating depression and Alzheimer's disease. In a prospective study,
                researchers listed tomatoes as a beneficial fruit to enhance the nutritional diversity of your diet. Tomatoes add
                vitamins B and E, which can limit neural degeneration.</p>

            <p><b>Good for eye health</b></p>
            <p>Beta-carotene and lycopene are readily available in tomatoes and serve a dual function as an antioxidant and vitamin
                A precursor. These carotenoids aid in the filtration of harmful light entering the eyes.</p>

            <p><b>Provides healthier skin</b></p>
            <p>Biotin and vitamin C upregulate protein production including collagen for skin repair, scar regression, and

                your diet.</p>

            <p><b>Supports bone health</b></p>
            <p>Tomatoes have two essential minerals for humans. Magnesium functions as a cofactor for calcitonin, which is a hormone
                that redirects calcium from the blood into bones. Potassium is another important mineral that prevents metabolic
                acidosis of bones, which prevents calcium loss as you age.</p>

            <p> During pregnancy, It is recommended to increase one’s intake of vitamins. This prevents the risk of both birth
                complications and defects. Scientists from the University of Florida developed a way to engineer folate-dense
                tomatoes, which in turn can protect the mother and fetus from developmental problems. Folic acid is a B vitamin that
                is used to supplement pregnancy for protection against neural tube defects.</p>

            <p><b>Prevents Anemia</b></p>
            <p> Tomatoes can also protect against anemia. The high amount of vitamin C in tomatoes is essential for the absorption
                of iron. Not to mention, consuming up to one cup of sun-dried tomatoes provides you with ⅓ of your daily recommended
                iron intake. Great to fight colds and coughs.</p>
