       <p>
          Antioxidants protect your cells from free radicals. Free radicals
          are molecules formed by breaching food or exposure to smoke or
          tobacco radiation in your body.</p>

        <p>
          Antioxidants, including vitamins C & E and carotenoids, help protect
          cells against damage from free radicals. The fruits, nuts, seeds,
          herbs and spices, and even cocoa, vegetables are also good sources of
          antioxidants.</p>
        <p>
          Eating the right quality products is very important, and also the
          thing that has to be kept in mind is that you consume everything in a
          balanced form. Antioxidants also form an essential part of our diet
          and must not be ignored. You must consume fruits and vegetables that
          are rich in antioxidants to lower down the risk of several deadly
          diseases. Also, these fruits can help you fight against cancer and
          diabetes.</p>

        <p> Antioxidant sources may be natural or human-made. It is believed that
          some plant-related foods are rich in antioxidants. Antioxidants based
          on plants are some type of phytonutrient or nutrient-dependent on
          plants.</p>

        <p><b>Antioxidants Rich Foods Are:</b></p>


        <p><b>Fruits </b></p>
        <p> Many fruits are high in antioxidants, packed with vitamins, and
          beneficial in a many of ways. These include cranberries, red grapes,
          peaches, raspberries, strawberries, red currants, figs, cherries,
          pears, guava, oranges, apricots, mango, red grapes, cantaloupe,
          watermelon, papaya, and tomatoes.</p>

        <p><b>Dried Fruits </b></p>
        <p>With the water removed, the antioxidant ratio is higher in dried
          fruits than in fresh. They can easily be carried with you in your
          purse, briefcase or car and they make a quick healthy snack.
          Consider taking along dried pears, plums, apples, peaches, figs,
          dates and raisins. However, be careful of sugar content; avoid dried
          fruits that have processed sugars added to them to make them
          sweeter.</p>

        <p><b>Vegetables </b></p>
        <p> Didn't your mother always tell you to eat your vegetables? Broccoli,
          spinach, carrots and potatoes are all high in antioxidants, and so
          are artichokes, cabbage, asparagus, avocados, beetroot, radish,
          lettuce, sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, collard greens and kale.</p>

        <p><b>Spices and Herbs </b></p>
        <p>Using lots of spices in cooking is good. Many are loaded with
          antioxidants, like cinnamon, oregano, turmeric, cumin, parsley,
          basil, curry powder, mustard seed, ginger, pepper, chili powder,
          paprika, garlic, coriander, onion and cardamom. Herbs include sage,
          thyme, marjoram, tarragon, peppermint, oregano, savory, basil and
          dill weed. All contribute complexity and flavor to your meals, but
          also are high in antioxidants.</p>

        <p><b>Cereals and Nuts </b></p>
        <p>Your morning corn flakes, oatmeal and granola bars pack a healthy
          punch, as do walnuts, hazelnuts, pistachio nuts, almonds, cashews,
          macadamia nuts and even that peanut butter sandwich.</p>

        <p><b>Beverages </b></p>
        <p> Contrary to popular belief, most of our antioxidants come from
          beverages. Apple juice, cider, tomato juice, pomegranate juice and
          pink grapefruit juice seem obvious, and green tea has become very
          popular as a source, but black tea and plain tea have high levels
          also. Here's good news for those who love that cup of joe in the
          morning: coffee is high but should be consumed in moderation. Note
          that adding milk to coffee or tea blocks antioxidants.</p>

        <p>
          Remember to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables in a many of
          colors. Don't just focus on the top 2 or 3 choices. Foods with
          darker, richer colors like orange, yellow, blue, and red tend to be
          higher in antioxidants, and with all these choices, you'll never
          become bored or run out of delicious, nutritious options. Variety is
          the spice of life.</p>
