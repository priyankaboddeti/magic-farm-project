             <p>
              We all know that eating fresh fruits and vegetables is an essential part of
              our daily diet. Many people are now choosing locally grown when shopping for
              produce. But buying locally grown food is not only good for the environment
              and the economy, it’s also great for your health.
            </p>

            <p><b> 1. Local food is fresher</b></p>
            <p>
              Local food is fresher, tastes better and is likely more nutritious. At a
              farmer’s market, most local produce has been picked within the last 24 hours,
              ensuring it is ripe and at its peak nutrient-density.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, most supermarket produce was picked days or weeks prior to
              reaching the grocery store shelf. As soon as a food is harvested its nutrient
              content begins to deteriorate, specifically vitamins C, E, A and some B. Of
              course, produce that has travelled still has nutritional value, but the
              fresher the fruit or vegetable the more nutrient-dense it will be.
            </p>

            <p><b>2. Supports your seasonal needs</b></p>
            <p>
              When you eat locally, you eat with the seasons, and the cycle of seasonal
              produce is perfectly designed to support your health. If you get back to
              basics and consider how we ate before the modern grocery store, we simply ate
              what was available to us at that time of year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eating seasonally is the most natural way to eat, and one of the most
              beneficial to our bodies. In the peak of summer, our bodies require cooling
              foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, and berries to help us handle the
              elements, while in the dark and cold days of winter we need rich and warming
              high-fat foods, root vegetables, and fermented foods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eating seasonally also helps to avoid eating the same thing all year round,
              which is less than ideal for your health. Our local seasons provides the ideal
              foods for our body’s natural needs based on our geographic location.
            </p>

            <p><b>3. Helps you discover new foods</b></p>
            <p>
              Eating well can get boring if you stick to the basics; there are only so many
              times you can eat oatmeal and roti for breakfast and chicken with rice for
              dinner. For instance, how many varieties of tomato can you find at your local
              grocery store? Maybe 3? Local farmers are keeping nearly 300 varieties of
              tomatoes alive every single year, leaving little room for boredom. How often
              do you eat different varieties of fruits? Whether you chose to visit your
              local farmers market, eating seasonally forces you to try to foods and be more
              creative in the kitchen.
            </p>

            <p><b>4. Helps you eat mindfully</b></p>
            <p>
              It’s easy to scarf down a microwavable meal when you know nothing about where
              it came from, who produced it, and how it got to your plate. However, when you
              shop locally you are more connected to the food you eat; knowing who produced
              it, what farm it came from, and exactly how it got from farm to fork. It’s the
              same way mom’s homemade tomato sauce evokes a very different feeling and
              connection than the stuff you grab at the drug store while buying your
              toothpaste. When it comes to eating mindfully, there are many more components
              than just what we are eating, the who, where, when, how and why are just as
              important, if not more. Shopping and eating locally make you more connected to
              your food and the impacts it has on your body.
            </p>

            <p><b>5. Produces less waste</b></p>
            <p>
              Because buying local shortens the distribution chain, forcing food directly
              from the farm to fork, less waste is produced in the process. Not only does
              buying local mean less packaging via transportation and shipping, but it also
              means less environmental waste from pollution and less food waste in the
              process as well. Buying from a local farm or shopping at the weekly farmer’s
              market means next to no food packaging at all, ensures food was moved directly
              from a local farm to you, minimising emissions and food waste in the process.
            </p>

            <p><b>6. Supports local business</b></p>
            <p>
              When you buy food in the grocery store most of the cost you incur goes to the
              transportation, processing, packaging, refrigeration, and marketing of that
              food, and not necessarily to the farmers themselves. When you buy from a local
              farmer, farmers market, or local shop you are supporting your local community,
              and your money goes back into producing more local food for you.
            </p>

            <p><b>7. Supports sustainable agriculture</b></p>
            <p>
              Eating locally encourages diversification of local agriculture and crop
              variety. This, in turn, reduces the reliance on monoculture; single crops
              grown over a wide area to the detriment of soils. The reality is that our food
              is only as nutrient-dense as the soil in which it is grown; although
              strawberries are known to contain high levels of vitamin C, these levels are
              heavily dependent on the quality of the soil in which they are grown, and
              their level of freshness.
            </p>

            <p><b> 8. Gives power to the customer</b></p>
            <p>
              People have very strong opinions about the state of our food and agriculture
              systems, be it positive or negative, but the reality is that as a customer you
              have a choice. If you choose not to grow, harvest and raise your own food, you
              vote with your paisa every single time you buy food. So, if you buy processed
              foods or imported foods you are creating more demand for these products. In
              contrast, if you buy local and demand local foods at your local grocery store,
              you are creating a very different and important demand. Every time you buy
              from a local farmer you have an opportunity to ask questions, learn about
              their farming practices and gain a better understanding of your food.
            </p>

            <p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>
            <p>
              The benefits of eating local food are endless, the greatest being the
              connection it gives you to your food. It’s scary to think how far removed we
              have become from our food; many of us eat foods never knowing if they grew
              from a plant, tree, shrub or bush. The more you eat locally the more you are
              able to reconnect with food and recognize the importance of real food and how
              it impacts your body. By supporting local farmers today, you are ensuring that
              there will be local farms in your community tomorrow, and that is something
              that we can all agree is important.
