            <h3>Why Organic Farming And Benefits</h3>

          <p>
            Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides,
            reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface
            water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are
            counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and generally lower yields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organic Farming in India is getting popularity every year and
            farmers/individuals/retired persons from different states are successfully
            adopting organic farming techniques in and earning decent revenues, at the
            same time adding value in maintaining a healthy ecosystem on the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            It relies on ecologically balanced agricultural principles like crop rotation,
            green manure, organic waste, biological pest control, mineral and rock
            additives. Organic farming makes use of pesticides and fertilizers if they are
            considered natural and avoids the use of various petrochemical fertilizers and
            pesticides.
          </p>
          <p><b>Why Organic? </b></p><br/>

          <p><b>1.Keep chemicals out of our bodies</b></p>
          <p>
            Many foods have residues of poisonous chemicals used as pesticides in their
            production. Many systemic pesticides cannot be removed by washing. Pesticides
            pose serious health risks. Numerous studies show that pesticides can increase
            the risk of cancer, adversely affect the nervous and endocrine systems and
            decrease fertility.
          </p>

          <p><b>2. Protect future generations</b></p>
          <p>
            Before a mother first breastfeeds her new born, the toxic risk from pesticides
            has already begun. Studies show that unborn babies are exposed to hundreds of
            harmful chemicals in-utero. Organically grown food is safe food, free from the
            dangers of poisons and chemicals, which is especially important for children,
            who have a lower body weight than adults and developing systems and brains.
          </p>

          <p><b>3. Avoid hormones, antibiotics and drugs in animal products</b></p>
          <p>
            Dairy cows and meat animals are routinely injected with growth hormones and
            antibiotics. These get passed into the milk /meat we consume and harm the
            health, especially of children.
          </p>

          <p><b> 4. Better Nutrition, Better Taste</b></p>
          <p>
            Fresh organic produce contains more vitamins, minerals, enzymes and
            antioxidants than chemically produced food. Organic foods are also
            consistently judged tastier.
          </p>

          <p><b>5. Reduce Environmental Pollution</b></p>
          <p>
            Chemical agriculture wreaks havoc on the environment. Pesticides seep into
            groundwater, and can cause loss of aquatic life, birds and wildlife. Chemical
            fertilizer dependency has taken a toll on the natural health of the soil.
          </p>

          <p><b> 6. Support Farmer’s Livelihoods</b></p>
          <p>
            Organic farming reduces dependency on external inputs like seeds, fertilizers
            and pesticides. Instead they are produced from cow dung, bio-mass, beneficial
            herbs and leaves. Dependence on expensive inputs purchased from outside leads
            to financial distress of farmers.
          </p>

          <p><b> 7. Protect the health of farmers</b></p>
          <p>
            Close and continuous contact with agricultural poisons makes farmers more
            susceptible to cancer, respiratory problems and other major diseases. India’s
            farmers are exposed to numerous pesticides that are banned in developed
            countries. Many farmers turn to organic methods after experiencing the
            ill-effects of pesticides. Studies have shown some of the pesticides induce
            suicidal tendency.
          </p>

          <p><b> 8. Promote native seed diversity</b></p>
          <p>
            Traditional seeds developed by Indian farmers are naturally pest-resistant,
            nutritious and suited to local conditions. Chemical farming promotes the use
            of Hybrid non-native seeds.
          </p>

          <p><b>9. Avoid eating Genetically Modified (GM) food</b></p>
          <p>
            Organic standards do not allow any genetically modified seeds and inputs. GM
            foods, if approved for the market in India, cannot be distinguished from other
            foods. Going organic is the sure way to know your foods are free of GMOs.
          </p>

          <p><b>10. Promote Biodiversity</b></p>
          <p>
            Visit an organic farm and you’ll notice something: a buzz of animal, bird and
            insect activity. Native plants and birds return usually after the first season
            of organic practices.
