            <p> Millets – ‘Siri Dhanyaalu ‘as they fondly call them these days are
            becoming very popular in India. People are tending towards a
            healthy living and are becoming conscious of what they eat, as the
            knowledge on the ill effects of pesticide and chemical prone food
            are becoming evident these days. </p>


          <p> Millets, were once used extensively in India as staple food, but
            gradually lost their importance in the diet as the world became
            fast and got attracted towards western food habits along with
            western culture of fast foods. The time took a circular turn now
            and people started using different kinds of millets to maintain
            their health. </p>


          <p> Millets are nothing but coarse grains and are store houses of
            protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Different varieties of
            millets such as Sorgham (Jawar), Finger Millets (Ragi), Foxtail
            Millet (Korra), Kodo Millet(Arike), Little Millet (Sama), Pearl
            Millet (Bajra), Proso Millet (Variga), Barnyard Millet (Vudha) are
            coming into use gradually now, as people started gaining awareness
            on their health benefits. </p>


          <p>There was once a time when people used to say that the millets are
            used as fodder for cattle. But you can’t imagine the numerous
            health benefits they offer. Unaware of their nutritional benefits
            they are given a tag of ‘Poor man’s food’. As they are less tasty
            compared to rice and wheat people reduced using them. Once you
            know the benefits you would surely shift to millet diet leaving
            alone white rice which contains merely sugars and nothing more. </p>


          <p><b>Easy to Grow</b></p>

          <p> Millets are very easy to grow, as they need less water and are
            less prone to pests. They can grow in harsh weather conditions as
            well. They have a short growing period and hence are farmer
            friendly. Due to its high resistance against harsh conditions,
            millets are sustainable to the environment, to the farmer growing
            it, and provide cheap and high nutrient options for all. Nearly 40
            percent of the food produced in India is wasted every year.
            Millets do not get spoiled easily, and some of the millets are
            good for consumption even after 10-12 years of growing, thus
            providing food security, and playing an important role in keeping
            a check on food wastage. </p>
