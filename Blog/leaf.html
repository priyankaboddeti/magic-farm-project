           <p>
                We all know we should be eating a diet consisting of colorful, varied fruit
                and vegetables. Leafy green vegetables provide a range of health benefits as
                part of a balanced diet. Green veg is high in antioxidants, minerals, fiber,
                and much more. They keep you hydrated and can even make you feel happier.
              </p>


              <p><b> 1) High in Antioxidants</b></p>

              <p>
                Green vegetables are rich in vitamin A – good for building your body’s natural
                defenses, vitamin C for healthy skin and bones, and vitamin K to help your
                body heal itself quickly when necessary. In addition to these vitamins,
                beautiful green veg is also rich in potassium and iron.
              </p>

              <p><b>2) Full of Minerals</b></p>

              <p>
                Green leafy vegetables, particularly spinach, are known for being high in
                magnesium. Magnesium is a mineral necessary for maintaining muscle health, as
                well as bone formation – helping the absorption of calcium.
              </p>

              <p><b>3) A Natural Source of Fibre</b></p>

              <p>
                Greens are a brilliant source of natural fiber, aiding digestion and slowing
                the rate at which your body absorbs sugar. This prevents sharp rises in blood
                glucose.
              </p>

              <p><b>4) Improves Your Metabolism</b></p>

              <p>
                As leafy, crunchy fresh greens are high in iron and fiber, they naturally
                improve our metabolism and keep the production of our red blood cells at a
                healthy rate. So, pile your plate high!
              </p>

              <p><b>5) Makes You Feel Fuller for Longer</b></p>

              <p>
                As high fiber vegetables, greens are the perfect solution for rumbling
                stomachs. The more you eat, the less likely you are to reach for the junk in
                the cupboard!
              </p>

              <p><b>6) Protects Your Eyes</b></p>

              <p>
                As mentioned previously, Lutein and zeaxanthin, plant pigments found in dark
                green leafy vegetables are said to have beneficial effects on your eyes’
                macular pigment levels when eating at least 10mg a day.
              </p>

              <p><b>7) Edible Sun Protection</b></p>

              <p>
                Now don’t go throwing away your sunscreen just yet – we’re not saying your
                green veg is a substitute! However, it is said to increase your body’s natural
                defenses against sun damage and even repair, thanks to your green vegetables’
                vitamin content, folic acid, and beta-carotene.
              </p>

              <p><b>8) Lifts Your Mood</b></p>

              <p>
                Your green leafy vegetables are a great source of folate, and as this
                contributes to serotonin production, you may find your mood lifting.
              </p>

              <p><b>9) Keeps You Hydrated</b></p>

              <p>
                Finally, green vegetables contain a lot of water, which means adding them to
                your plate helps to keep you hydrated, maintaining healthy skin and hair.
              </p>

              <p><b>10) Memory prolongers</b></p>

              <p>
                One study of adults with an average age of 81 found those who ate one to two
                daily servings of green leafy vegetables had the cognitive function of a
                person 11 years younger, compared with those who avoided them. This was
                probably due to the folate, beta-carotene, and vitamin K that leafy greens
                contain.
