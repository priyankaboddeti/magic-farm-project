            <div class="col-md-6 content1">

 <p>Broccoli is a good source of fiber and protein and contains iron, potassium, calcium, selenium, and magnesium as well
                as the vitamins A, C, E, K, and a good array of B vitamins including folic acid.</p>

            <p><b> Here are some of the benefits of broccoli:</b></p>
            <p><b>1. Cancer prevention:</b></p>

            <p>Broccoli shares cancer-fighting and immune-boosting properties with other cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower,
            Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. Broccoli contains properties that deplete estrogens which usually cause cancer in the
            body. Research shows that broccoli is extremely suitable for preventing breast and uterus cancer.</p>

                <p><b>2. Cholesterol reduction:</b></p>

                <p>Like many whole foods, broccoli is packed with soluble fiber that draws cholesterol out of your body. This is
                because the fiber in broccoli helps bind with bile acids in the digestive tract. This makes excreting cholesterol
                out of our bodies easy. According to research by the Institute of Food Research, a particular variety of broccoli
                can help reduce the blood LDL-cholesterol levels by 6 percent.</p>


                <p><b>3. Reducing allergic reaction and inflammation:</b></p>>
                <p>Research has shown the ability of kaempferol to lessen the impact of allergy-related substances on our bodies.
                Broccoli even has significant amounts of omega 3 fatty acids, which are well known as an anti-inflammatory. Along
                with this, broccoli can also help people suffering from arthritis as broccoli contains sulforaphane, a chemical that
                blocks the enzymes that can cause joint destruction and hence lead to inflammation.</p>


                <p><b>4. Powerful antioxidant: </b></p>
                <p>Broccoli contains antioxidants that can help the body in a variety of ways. Broccoli is deeply concentrated with
                vitamin C, making it great for immunity. Other than this, broccoli also contains flavonoids which help recycle the
                vitamin C efficiently. It is also enriched with carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, and other
                power-packed antioxidants.</p>


                <p><b>5. Bone health:</b></p>
                <p>Broccoli contains high levels of both calcium and vitamin K, both of which are important for bone health and the
                prevention of osteoporosis. Along with calcium, broccoli is also full of other nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and
                phosphorous. Because of these properties, broccoli is extremely suitable for children, the elderly, and lactating
                mothers.</p>

                <p><b>6. Heart health: </b></p>
                <p>The anti-inflammatory properties of sulforaphane, one of the isothiocyanates (ITCs) in broccoli, may be able to
                prevent (or even reverse) some of the damage to blood vessels linings that can be caused by inflammation due to
                chronic blood sugar problems. Broccoli is great for heart health as it contains fibers, fatty acids, and vitamins
                that help to regulate blood pressure in the body. This also helps in reducing bad cholesterol, hence leading to a
                healthy heart. Broccoli helps to protect blood vessels from damage as well.</p>


                <p><b>7. Diet aid:</b></p>
                <p> Broccoli is a good carb and is high in fiber, which aids in digestion, prevents constipation, maintains low blood
                sugar, and curbs overeating. Along with this, broccoli is also great for weight loss because it is rich in fiber. It
                is an ideal green vegetable to include in your salads and completing your five colored vegetables every day. In
                addition to this, broccoli also contains proteins, making it suitable for vegetarians that are otherwise not able to
                complete their protein requirement.</p>


                <p><b>8. Great for detoxification: </b></p>
                <p>Since broccoli is rich in fiber, it can help get rid of toxins through the digestive tract. Other than this,
                broccoli is also full of antioxidants that help in the overall detoxification of the body. Broccoli includes special
                phytonutrients that help in the bodyâ€™s detox process. This means that the body gets rids of unwanted contaminants.
                Broccoli also contains isothiocyanates, which help in the detox process at the genetic level.</p>


                <p><b>9. Skincare: </b></p>
                <p>Skincare not only includes glow but also its immunity. Since broccoli is a powerhouse of antioxidants and nutrients
                like vitamin C and minerals such as copper and zinc, broccoli helps in maintaining healthy skin. This means it also
                protects the skin from getting infections as well as keeps the natural glow of your skin. Broccoli is full of
                vitamin K, amino acids, and folates, making it ideal for maintaining healthy skin immunity.</p>



                <p><b>10. Eyecare: </b></p>
                <p>Broccoli contains beta-carotene, vitamin A, phosphorous, and other vitamins such as B complex, vitamin C and E. All
                these rich nutrients are great for eye health as these help in protecting the eyes against macular degeneration,
                cataract and even repairs the damage done by harmful radiations we go through by being constantly on our phones or
                being in front of a screen.</p>


                <p><b>11. Anti-ageing:</b></p>
                <p>Since broccoli is enriched with vitamin C, which has numerous antioxidant properties, it is great for anti-aging.
                This is because antioxidants help fight the free radicals responsible for aging. These free radicals often damage
                the skin. Eating broccoli regularly helps in reducing fine lines, wrinkles, skin issues like acne, and even
                pigmentation.</p>


                <p><b>12. Prevents and fights pollution and toxins:</b></p>
                <p> Broccoli is a nutrient-rich vegetable with many helpful vitamins, minerals. What makes it an effective
                anti-pollution food is its ability to act down on certain pollutants. It's not the sprouts themselves but the
                components found in the stub which are good for the body.</p>
