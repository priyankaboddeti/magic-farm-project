              <b>PATNA:</b> At a time when Bihar farmers are increasingly
              losing crops to animal invasion and thefts, an IITian’s startup
              may hold key to tackling both. IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Ajit Kumar
              has developed an artificial intelligence-driven Farm
              Surveillance-Cum-Animal Scarer (FSCAS), which is helping farmers
              to keep animals at bay and thieves away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), the FSASD is a
              computerized electronic sensor device, which monitors the farms
              and agricultural field using day-and-night camera and AI-based
              algorithms running on the device continuously.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kumar says the gadget can be installed at key locations on the
              field. The moment it spots an animal or theft, it starts
              blaring, besides sending alert to the mobile handsets of the
              farmers. The device is artificial intelligence-driven and has
              computerised sensors. It also is equipped with night-vision
              cameras.
            </p>
            <p>
              A resident of Shyampur in Bhagalpur, Ajit Kumar quit his job at
              an MNC to come up with the farmer-friendly start-up idea named
              Stepupify. The gadget was developed in association with his
              batchmate Sagar Kumar.

            <p>
              “This device is battery powered and can be mounted on a pole or
              tree in the field along with installed solar panels to charge
              the battery. It can be customised as per farmers’ request and
              has been tested in the fields at Khirighat (Antichak) in
              Kahalgaon sub-division,” Kumar said. As of now, the contraption
              costs Rs 15,000.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gadget’s credibility is vouched for by many farmers in
              Lalapur, Bhader and Kahalgaon. “The sensor immediately
              identifies any attempt to intrude into the field. We may add
              more sensors in future to bolster surveillance,” Kumar says.
              Kumar’s Stepupify Labs also imparts training to youths in
              robotics, STEM and in preparation for JEE (Main and advance)
              with the support of Kumar’s wife Alka.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, Kumar says, through his village-based labs, he
              developed a UVC Sanitizer Robot for Covid sanitisation and that
              was tested and tried by the Indian Railways.
